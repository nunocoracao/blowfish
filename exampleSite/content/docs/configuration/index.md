Blowfish is a highly customisable theme and uses some of the latest Hugo features to simplify how it is configured.

The theme ships with a default configuration that gets you up and running with a basic blog or static website.

{{< alert "fire" >}}
We just launched a CLI tool to help you get started with Blowfish. It will help you with installation and configuration. Install the CLI tool globally using:

```bash
npx blowfish-tools
```

{{< /alert >}}

> Configuration files bundled with the theme are provided in TOML format as this is the default Hugo syntax. Feel free to convert your config to YAML or JSON if you wish.

The default theme configuration is documented in each file so you can freely adjust the settings to meet your needs.

{{< alert >}}
As outlined in the [installation instructions]({{< ref "/docs/installation#set-up-theme-configuration-files" >}}), you should adjust your theme configuration by modifying the files in the `config/_default/` folder of your Hugo project and delete the `config.toml` file in your project root.
{{< /alert >}}

## Site configuration

Standard Hugo configuration variables are respected throughout the theme, however there are some specific things that should be configured for the best experience.

The site configuration is managed through the `config/_default/config.toml` file. The table below outlines all the settings that the Blowfish takes advantage of.

Note that the variable names provided in this table use dot notation to simplify the TOML data structure (ie. `outputs.home` refers to `[outputs] home`).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `"blowfish"` | When using Hugo Modules this config value should be removed. For all other installation types, this must be set to `blowfish` for the theme to function. |
| `baseURL` | _Not set_ | The URL to the root of the website. |
| `defaultContentLanguage` | `"en"` | This value determines the default language of theme components and content. Refer to the [language and i18n](#language-and-i18n) section below for supported language codes. |
| `enableRobotsTXT` | `true` | When enabled, a `robots.txt` file will be created in the site root that allows search engines to crawl the entire site. If you prefer to provide your own pre-made `robots.txt`, set to `false` and place your file in the `static` directory. For complete control, you may provide a [custom layout]({{< ref "content-examples#custom-layouts" >}}) to generate this file. |
| `pagination.pagerSize` | `10` | The number of articles listed on each page of the article listing. |
| `summaryLength` | `0` | The number of words that are used to generate the article summary when one is not provided in the [front matter]({{< ref "front-matter" >}}). A value of `0` will use the first sentence. This value has no effect when summaries are hidden. |
| `outputs.home` | `["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]` | The output formats that are generated for the site. Blowfish requires HTML, RSS and JSON for all theme components to work correctly. |
| `permalinks` | _Not set_ | Refer to the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/configuration/permalinks/) for permalink configuration. |
| `taxonomies` | _Not set_ | Refer to the [Organising content]({{< ref "getting-started#organising-content" >}}) section for taxonomy configuration. |
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Thumbnails

Blowfish was built so it would be easy to add visual support to your articles. If your familiar with Hugo article structure, you just need to place an image file (almost all formats are supported but we recommend `.png` or `.jpg`) that starts with `feature*` inside your article folder. And that's it, Blowfish will then able to both use the image as a thumbnail within your website as well as for <a target="_blank" href="https://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a> cards across social platforms.

[Here]({{< ref "thumbnails" >}}) is also a guide with more info and a [sample]({{< ref "thumbnail_sample" >}}) if you want to see how you can do it.

## Language and i18n

Blowfish is optimised for full multilingual websites and theme assets are translated into several languages out of the box. The language configuration allows you to generate multiple versions of your content to provide a customised experience to your visitors in their native language.

The theme currently supports the following languages by default:

| Language                     | Code    |
| ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Arabic                       | `ar`    |
| Bulgarian                    | `bg`    |
| Bengali                      | `bn`    |
| Catalan                      | `ca`    |
| Czech                        | `cs`    |
| German                       | `de`    |

| Finnish                      | `fi`    |
| French                       | `fr`    |
| Galician                     | `gl`    |
| Hebrew                       | `he`    |
| Croatian                     | `hr`    |
| Hungarian                    | `hu`    |
| Indonesian                   | `id`    |
| Italian                      | `it`    |
| Japanese                     | `ja`    |
| Korean                       | `ko`    |
| Dutch                        | `nl`    |
| Persian                      | `fa`    |
| Polish                       | `pl`    |
| Portuguese (Brazil)          | `pt-br` |
| Portuguese (Portugal)        | `pt-pt` |
| Romanian                     | `ro`    |
| Russian                      | `ru`    |
| Thai                         | `th`    |
| Turkish                      | `tr`    |
| Vietnamese                   | `vi`    |
| Simplified Chinese (China)   | `zh-cn` |
| Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) | `zh-tw` |

The default translations can be overridden by creating a custom file in `i18n/[code].yaml` that contains the translation strings. You can also use this method to add new languages. If you'd like to share a new translation with the community, please [open a pull request](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/pulls).

### Configuration

In order to be as flexible as possible, a language configuration file needs to be created for each language on the website. By default Blowfish includes an English language configuration at `config/_default/languages.en.toml`.

The default file can be used as a template to create additional languages, or renamed if you wish to author your website in a language other than English. Simply name the file using the format `languages.[language-code].toml`.

{{< alert >}}
**Note:** Ensure the `defaultContentLanguage` parameter in the [site configuration](#site-configuration) matches the language code in your language config filename.  
{{< /alert >}}

#### Global

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `languageCode` | `"en"` | The Hugo language code for this file. It can be a top-level language (ie. `en`) or a sub-variant (ie. `en-au`) and should match the language code in the filename. Hugo expects this value to always be in lowercase. For proper HTML compliance, set the `isoCode` parameter which is case-sensitive. |
| `languageName` | `"English"` | The name of the language. |
| `weight` | `1` | The weight determines the order of languages when building multilingual sites. |

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Menus

Blowfish also supports language-specific menu configurations. Menu config files follow the same naming format as the languages file. Simply provide the language code in the file name to tell Hugo which language the file relates to.

Menu config files are named with the format `menus.[language-code].toml`. Always ensure that the language code used in the menus configuration matches the languages configuration.

The [Getting Started]({{< ref "getting-started#menus" >}}) section explains more about the structure of this file. You can also refer to the [Hugo menu docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/) for more configuration examples.

## Theme parameters

Blowfish provides a large number of configuration parameters that control how the theme functions. The table below outlines every available parameter in the `config/_default/params.toml` file.

Many of the article defaults here can be overridden on a per article basis by specifying it in the front matter. Refer to the [Front Matter]({{< ref "front-matter" >}}) section for further details.

## Other configuration files

The theme also includes a `markup.toml` configuration file. This file contains some important parameters that ensure that Hugo is correctly configured to generate sites built with Blowfish.

Always ensure this file is present in the config directory and that the required values are set. Failure to do so may cause certain features to function incorrectly and could result in unintended behaviour.
