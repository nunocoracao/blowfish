Welcome to Blowfish, one of the most flexible and robust Hugo themes. Here you can find the complete [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Blowfish is highly customizable and can be configured to fit your needs: from a static website to a blog. Checkout some [examples](/examples) and what some of our [users](/users) have been building.

Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "samples" >}}) to get a feel for what Blowfish can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish">Github</a> or read the [Installation guide]({{< ref "docs/installation" >}}) to get started.
