{{< lead >}}
A powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.
{{< /lead >}}

This is a demo site built entirely using Congo. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.

  <span class="flex items-center ltr:pr-3 rtl:pl-3 text-primary-400">
    {{< icon "triangle-exclamation" >}}
  </span>
  <span class="flex items-center justify-between grow dark:text-neutral-300">
    <span class="prose dark:prose-invert">This is a demo of the <code id="layout">page</code> layout.</span>
    <button
